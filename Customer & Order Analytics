#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--How many orders was placed in January:
SELECT COUNT(orderid) from BIT_DB.JanSales;

--How many orders was for the Iphone:

SELECT COUNT (orderid) from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product= 'iPhone';

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February

SELECT acctnum From BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid ;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product,price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
Order by price limit 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, product From BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, 
SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
